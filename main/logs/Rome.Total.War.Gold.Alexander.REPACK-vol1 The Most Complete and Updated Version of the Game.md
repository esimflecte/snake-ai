Achievements of Alexander the Great Alexander the Great is widely regarded as one of the greatest military leaders and conquerors of all time. He achieved many remarkable feats during his short but eventful life. Some of his most notable achievements are:
 
- He unified the Greek city-states under his rule and secured their loyalty by granting them autonomy and freedom.
- He defeated the mighty Persian empire, which had been the dominant power in the region for centuries. He also adopted some of their customs and policies, such as wearing Persian clothes, marrying Persian princesses, and appointing Persian officials.
- He spread Greek culture and civilization across his vast empire, which spanned from Europe to Asia. He founded many cities, most of them named after him, such as Alexandria in Egypt, which became a center of learning and commerce. He also encouraged cultural exchange and intermarriage among his subjects.
- He explored new lands and regions that were unknown to the Greeks, such as India and Central Asia. He encountered different peoples and cultures, such as the Egyptians, the Jews, the Indians, and the Scythians. He also collected specimens of plants and animals for scientific study.
- He inspired generations of rulers and generals who admired his courage, charisma, and vision. He was regarded as a hero and a model by many historical figures, such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Alexander Pushkin.

Alexander the Great died in 323 B.C.E. in Babylon, possibly from malaria or typhoid fever. His empire soon collapsed after his death, as his generals fought for control over his territories. However, his legacy lived on in the history and culture of the regions he conquered. He is remembered as one of the most influential figures in world history.
